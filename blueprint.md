# NavaSanganakah Multiventures - Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and technical implementation of the NavaSanganakah Multiventures website. The goal is to create an immersive, high-end web experience that fuses futuristic technology with ancient Vedic astrology, embodying a "Neo-Vedic Cyberpunk" aesthetic.

## Approved Design & Style

### Core Concept: Neo-Vedic Cyberpunk (Astro-Spiritual Feel)

*   **Vibe:** Mystical yet highly advanced, attractive (Akarshan), vibrant (Rangeela), and full of dynamic motion. The final design emphasizes a spiritual, "dharmik," and "chamakdar" (shiny/glowing) astro feeling.
*   **Visuals:** A fusion of futuristic digital elements and sacred ancient Vedic symbols, particularly the Sri Yantra.

### Color Palette (Final)

*   **Primary Background:** `--cosmic-void` (#0d021a) - A deep, dark purple representing the cosmos.
*   **Spiritual Accents:**
    *   `--dharmik-saffron` (#ff9933)
    *   `--radiant-marigold` (#ffc300)
*   **Mystical Accent:** `--majestic-purple` (#8a2be2)
*   **Text & Stars:** `--star-white` (#f0f8ff)
*   **Overall Look:** Vibrant, glowing, and energetic, with light emerging from cosmic darkness, creating a divine and sacred atmosphere.

### Typography (Final)

*   **Headings:** `Orbitron` (modern, futuristic Sans-Serif) - Used for a high-tech feel.
*   **Body/Subtitles:** `Rajdhani` (elegant, slightly traditional) - Provides a clean and readable counterpoint.

### Layout & Effects (Final)

*   **Glassmorphism:** Content cards use a frosted glass effect with a `--majestic-purple` tint (`rgba(138, 43, 226, 0.1)`) and a `--radiant-marigold` border, creating a premium, layered look.
*   **Parallax Scrolling:** Elements float upwards on scroll, adding depth.
*   **Glow Effects:** Key elements like text and cards have a "chamakdar" neon glow to enhance the vibrant, energetic feel.

## Approved Features & Interactivity

### Hero Section

*   **Central Element:** A detailed, animated 3D Sri Yantra created with Three.js. It features two sets of interlocking triangles (upward in purple, downward in saffron) that rotate in opposite directions. The central "Bindu" point pulses with a golden light.
*   **Background:** A field of 15,000 twinkling digital stars provides a sense of deep space.

### Cursor Effects

*   **Trail:** The cursor leaves a trail of sparkling "stardust" using the `--radiant-marigold` color to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

### Animations & Motion

*   **Scroll Animations:** Sections and cards float upwards gracefully as the user scrolls down.
*   **Hover Effects:** Interactive elements like cards and buttons have enhanced glow and transform effects on hover.

## Development Status

### Homepage Redesign

*   **Status:** **Completed and Approved.**
*   **Action:** The homepage has been redesigned and finalized according to the user's feedback to create a more spiritual and astrological ("astro feeling") experience. This design is now the official blueprint for all future development.
