# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern, responsive website for NavaSanganakah Multiventures, a company that blends ancient wisdom with modern technology. The website showcases their services, projects, and products, while also providing information about the company and a way to contact them.

## Design and Features

### Aesthetics

*   **Color Palette:** The color scheme is inspired by cosmic and spiritual themes, with a primary palette of `--dharmik-saffron`, `--radiant-marigold`, `--majestic-purple`, `--cosmic-void`, and `--star-white`.
*   **Typography:** The website uses the 'Orbitron' font for headings and 'Rajdhani' for body text, creating a futuristic and clean look.
*   **Background:** A stardust background texture is used to enhance the cosmic theme.
*   **Glassmorphism:** The UI features glass-like cards with blurred backgrounds and subtle borders, creating a sense of depth.
*   **Glow Effects:** Headings and other elements have a neon glow effect, adding to the futuristic aesthetic.

### Interactivity

*   **Cursor Dust Trail:** A custom cursor effect leaves a trail of dust-like particles, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Scroll Animations:** Elements fade in and float up as the user scrolls down the page.
*   **Hover Effects:** Cards and links have hover effects that change their appearance and provide visual feedback.
*   **3D Animation:** The hero section features a 3D Sri Yantra animation created with Three.js.

### Components

*   **Navbar:** A custom navigation bar component (`<nav-bar>`) provides consistent navigation across all pages.
*   **Footer:** A custom footer component (`<footer-component>`) displays contact information, links, and copyright information.

## Current Plan

*   **Fix Three.js Error:** Resolve the JavaScript error caused by a breaking change in the Three.js library.
*   **Consolidate Styles:** Move all inline styles from the HTML files to the `style.css` file.
*   **Update HTML Structure:** Update the HTML files to use the new custom components and remove the old footer structure.
*   **Create Blueprint:** Create a `blueprint.md` file to document the project.
