# Blueprint: NavaSanganakah Multiventures Website Redesign

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for redesigning the NavaSanganakah Multiventures website. The goal is to create a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly website that effectively showcases the company's unique blend of technology and tradition.

## Current State

The existing website has a basic structure with the following sections:

*   Header with navigation
*   Hero section
*   "Our Verticals" section
*   "Founder's Corner" section
*   "Portfolio" section
*   Footer

The site uses placeholder images and has a minimal design.

## Redesign Plan

The redesign will focus on the following areas:

### 1. Visual Design

*   **Color Palette:** Implement a professional color scheme that reflects the company's brand.
*   **Typography:** Utilize the "Poppins" and "Khand" fonts to create a clear and engaging visual hierarchy.
*   **Layout:** Improve spacing, alignment, and overall composition for a more polished look.
*   **Iconography:** Use icons to enhance the "Our Verticals" section.
*   **Imagery:** Replace placeholder images with more relevant and high-quality images.

### 2. Web Components

*   **`nsm-card`:** Create a custom web component for the portfolio items. This will encapsulate the card's structure, style, and behavior, making it reusable and easy to manage.

### 3. Responsiveness

*   Ensure the website is fully responsive and provides an optimal viewing experience on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

### 4. Code Refinements

*   **HTML:** Update the HTML structure to be more semantic and accessible.
*   **CSS:** Rewrite the CSS in `style.css` to implement the new design.
*   **JavaScript:** Create the `nsm-card` web component in `main.js`.

## Actionable Steps

1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Create this document to outline the project plan.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Implement the new design with a modern and responsive layout.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Create the `<nsm-card>` web component.
4.  **Update `index.html`:** Refine the content and structure to align with the new design.
