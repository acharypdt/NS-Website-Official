            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div class="legal-container">
                <p><strong>NavaSanganakah (Modern Computer)</strong> is not just a business; it's a philosophy. Founded on the principle of bridging the timeless wisdom of the Vedas with the powerful tools of modern technology, we aim to create a more harmonious and enlightened world.</p>
                <p>Our journey began with a simple question: How can we use the digital age to preserve, promote, and practice the profound knowledge of our ancestors? This led to the birth of projects like <strong>'Yagya Ashram'</strong>, a digital platform for spiritual learning, and our 'Nakshatra Drishti' podcast, which makes complex astrological concepts accessible to all.</p>
                <p>We are a team of technologists, spiritualists, and artisans, all united by a common vision. Whether we are developing an app, consulting on an astrological chart, or crafting a natural product, we do it with intention, integrity, and a deep respect for the source of our inspiration.</p>
